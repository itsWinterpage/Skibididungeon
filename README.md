<h1>eaglercraft-server</h1>
Following the legacy of <a href="https://github.com/@ayunami2000">@ayunami2000</a>, a working replit eaglercraft-server with no missing items really.
<p>Some differences are this uses an apache webserver rather than nginx, and this server doesn't actually update, So I smashed in eaglercraft 1.5.2 service pack 1.01.</p>
<p>To get this into replit, just create a repl by clicking create repl and clicking import from github. Then, copy the link of this github repository and paste it in replit.</p>
<p>Then, start it by clicking the start button after the repl is finished creating.</p>
<p>NOTE&colon; Don't stop the server manually in the console or shell, kindly click the stop button.</p>
